# Nyrion-Javascript
Nyrion-Javascript is a JavaScript-based version of the Nyrion command-line tool. It’s a lightweight shell environment that runs in Node.js, designed to handle basic commands like file operations, creating files, writing content, and more — all through a custom terminal interface.

This version brings Nyrion’s core features to JavaScript, making it easier to integrate or experiment with the shell in JavaScript projects or systems that don’t use Python.
